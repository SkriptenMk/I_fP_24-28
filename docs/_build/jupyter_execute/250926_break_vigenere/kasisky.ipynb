       "'Business | H-1B sting\\nThe perverse consequence of America’s $100,000 visa\\nfees\\nOffshoring to India and other countries could accelerate\\nSave\\nShare\\nPhotograph: Getty Images\\nSep 22nd 2025|4 min read\\n“You GRADUATE from a college, I think you should get, automatically as part of your\\ndiploma, a green card [permanent residence in the United States],” promised Donald\\nTrump on the campaign trail last year. As president, on September 19th, Mr Trump headed\\nin the opposite direction. He proposed a charge of $100,000 on new applications for H-1B\\nvisas, a favourite of technology firms hiring foreign graduates. Each year 85,000 are issued\\nby lottery (demand far outstrips that quota). Hitherto the cost of securing one has been\\nabout $2,500 in legal and filing fees.\\nBig tech firms dominate the visas (see chart 1). Amazon alone received more than 14,000\\napprovals in 2025 (renewals do not count against the 85,000 quota). Indian IT-services\\ngiants such as Infosys, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), also routinely rank\\namong the top sponsors. And Indian citizens scoop most of the visas—about three-\\nquarters of them in 2023. Apart from China (12%), no other country secures more than 2%.\\nMany of Mr Trump’s supporters complain that this means jobs that could go to talented\\nAmericans go to Indian graduates instead. But the effects of the new charge may be more\\ncomplicated than they expect.\\nChart: The Economist\\nOver the weekend many of America’s tech giants scrambled to advise employees on H-1B\\nvisas not to leave the country until the rules are clarified; whether exemptions will be made\\nfor some groups remains uncertain. The announcement has been most keenly felt, though,\\nin India. In August Mr Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, sparing only essentials\\nsuch as electronics and pharmaceuticals. Now he has hit the country’s most successful\\nsector. According to Goldman Sachs, services exports grew from $53bn to $338bn\\nbetween 2005 and 2023, almost twice the global rate. That growth was driven by a boom in\\nIndia’s population of engineers, particularly in computer science. The IT firms relied on\\nsending engineers to America under the H-1B programme to serve clients, a cornerstone of\\ntheir business model. For decades H-1Bs offered Indian techies a route to better-paid jobs\\nin America. That path now looks far less certain.\\nFor India’s IT-services firms, which employ more than 5m people, the visa fees are an\\nadded headache. The rise of artificial intelligence has already unsettled the industry.\\nGenerative-AI tools threaten to erode demand for some of their bread-and-butter work.\\nGartner, a research firm, reckons that by 2029 more than half of user interactions tied to\\nenterprise processes, a crucial line of business, will be automated by AI. Some companies\\nhave already started trimming staff. In July TCS announced plans to cut 12,000 employees,\\nabout 2% of its workforce, citing a “skill mismatch”.\\nYet the industry is better placed to adapt than in the past. In Mr Trump’s first term, scrutiny\\nof visa applications was tightened, and rejection rates for Indian IT firms rose more than\\nfour-fold (see chart 2). Many responded by reducing their reliance on the visas, shifting\\nmore work offshore and recruiting more locals. Only about 8% of Infosys’s staff are now\\nbased in the Americas. Since 2018 more than 90% of its new hires there have been locals.\\nInvestors, too, seemed relaxed: the NIFTY IT index, a benchmark of leading services firms,\\nfell by just 3% on September 22nd, the first full day of trading after the announcement.\\nChart: The Economist\\nIndia’s tech workers, too, have alternatives beyond the big outsourcing firms.“ Global\\ncapability centres” (GCCs), set up by multinationals to offshore everything from data\\nanalysis to research and development, have become a pillar of India’s services sector. Eli\\nLilly, an American drugmaker, and Rolls-Royce, a British engine-maker, are among those\\nrelying on them for increasingly complex work. According to NASSCOM, an industry body,\\nthe number of GCCs has grown from 700 in 2010 to more than 1,700 last year. Together\\nthey generated $64bn in revenue and employed 1.9m people.\\nThe new visa fee could therefore accelerate the shift by multinationals to expand\\noperations in India. (Smaller startups, though, may find it harder to hire.) Research by Britta\\nGlennon, of the Wharton School, examining restrictions introduced in 2004, found that\\nfirms heavily reliant on H-1Bs increased their overseas employment by about a quarter\\ncompared with those less dependent on them. R&D-intensive jobs were among the first to\\nmove, and the main beneficiaries were Canada, China—and India. ■\\n'"
